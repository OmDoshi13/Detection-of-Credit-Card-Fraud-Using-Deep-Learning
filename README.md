# Detection-of-Credit-Card-Fraud-Using-Deep-Learning

**Securing Financial Transactions via Advanced Neural Networks**

This project deploys a high-precision deep learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging a specialized neural network architecture, it effectively tackles the challenge of class imbalance to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities with high accuracy.

## 🎯 Project Scope

* **Binary Classification:** Distinguishes strictly between Valid (0) and Fraudulent (1) transactions.
* **Imbalance Handling:** Utilizes **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to normalize the dataset distribution.
* **Performance Metrics:** Optimizes for high precision and recall, validated via **AUC-ROC** scores.

---

## 🧠 Neural Network Architecture

The solution implements a robust Deep Neural Network (DNN) designed for stability:

* **Input Layer:** Processes 28 PCA-transformed feature vectors.
* **Hidden Layers:**
    * Dense layers with **ReLU** activation.
    * **Dropout Regularization** to mitigate overfitting.
* **Output Layer:** Sigmoid activation for probability scoring.
* **Optimization:** Trained using **Adam** optimizer and **Binary Cross-Entropy** loss.
